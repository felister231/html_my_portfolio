<h2>Hobbies and intersts</h2>
<p>
    Outside of work, I'm an adventurous spirit who loves embracing new experiences. 
    I'm an avid hiker and outdoor enthusiast, and I've had the privilege of exploring various national 
    parks and hiking trails, both in my home country and abroad. These adventures have not only provided me 
    with unforgettable memories but have also instilled in me a sense of adaptability, 
    as I've often found myself facing unexpected challenges in remote locations.</p>

<p>In addition to my adventurous side, I'm also an ardent reader. 
I have a deep passion for literature, particularly novels.
 I find that reading allows me to explore new worlds, gain different perspectives, 
 and continuously expand my knowledge and imagination. It's a hobby that not only feeds my
 curiosity but also hones my communication and critical thinking skills, as I often engage in
  book discussions and write book reviews online.
